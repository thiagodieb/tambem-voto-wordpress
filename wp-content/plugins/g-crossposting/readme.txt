Imports your public Google+ activities in your Wordpress blog.

== Description ==

This plugin imports your public activities on Google Plus into your WordPress
blog. It creates a post for each Google+ activity you posted. The plugin
regulary checks your public Google+ profile for new activities and posts them
automatically to your blog.

With the Google+ Crossposting plugin, you can keep your blog readers updated on
what you are posting on Google+ without everyone requiring to also be on
Google+.

== Installation ==

Installation is pretty standard. In latest Wordpress versions, just go to the
plugin section and click the "Add new" button. Now search for "crossposting"
and locate this plugin. You are just a click away to install it :-)

If you want to go the manual way, just upload the plugin, activate it and check
the settings page of the plugin. Here are the details:

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Get your [Google API key](https://code.google.com/apis/console/)
1. Go to the plugin's setting page and enter your Google+ ID and Google API key
1. Make sure to also maintain the other settings on the page
1. After saving the settings, you may want to click on the mass import so that Google+ activities already available on your profile get imported to your blog.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I get my Google+ ID? =

Log in to Google+ and click on your name so that you get to your profile page.
The URL in your browser should now look something like:

https://plus.google.com/VERY-LONG-NUMBER/posts

This VERY-LONG-NUMBER is your Google+ ID. Copy just this VERY-LONG-NUMBER to your clipboard and paste it into the corresponding setting field.

Please note, you are just interested in this VERY-LONG-NUMBER without any slashes. It might also be that your URL looks a bit different like containing /u/0/, but this is not important. Did I already mention that you should only copy this VERY-LONG-NUMBER? :-)

If you have set a custom Google+ ID in your profile, the URL might look as follows:

https://plus.google.com/+SebastianStein/posts

In that case, your Google+ ID is +SebastianStein (so including the plus sign, but not any slashes).


= Where do I get a Google API key? =

1. Go to (https://cloud.google.com/console) and log in.
1. Click on "Projects" and go into the project "API Project".
1. Click on "APIs" in the left sidebar.
1. Find in the list "Google+ API" and enable it.
1. After it was enabled, click on "Credentials" in the left sidebar.
1. Click on "Create new key" under the heading "Public API access".
1. Select you want to create a "server key".
1. The string shown as API Key is your Google+ API key to use.


= I can't set my Google+ ID or Google API key in the setting form. Why do they disappear? =

After you entered a Google+ ID or Google API key in the settings form of this
plugin and confirm your change, the plugin will try to access your public
Google+ profile. For this purpose, it uses the Google+ ID and the Google API key
you provided. If access fails, one of both or even both of them must be wrong.
However, the plugin can't determine which one is wrong. Therefore, it removes
both settings again to show you that something must have been wrong.

= Everything is set up properly, but it doesn't import anything? =

This plugin only imports your public Google+ activities. It won't access your
private posts on Google+, which you only shared with some circles. If you have
never posted anything in public, this plugin won't import anything to your blog.

This should prevent that people make something public by accident. If you want
something to also appear in your blog, make sure to share it with the public
first!

= Where do post titles come from? =

Google+ provides a title for each post. There is no documentation how Google+
generates those titles.

You can set a custom title by starting your post with bold text. You can insert
bold text in your post by surrounding text with asterics characters, e.g. `*my
title*`.

If the plugin doesn't find bold text at the beginning of your post, it will use
the title generated by Google+ instead.

= Post titles are shortened, even if I set length to 0 (meaning unlimited length)? =

Google+ itself limits the length of a post title. If you set 0 for the length of
the post title, the plugin will import the whole title provided by Google+. If
Google+ shortens your title, there is nothing this plugin can do.

= How can I send you a donation? =

I appreciate your support very much! As I don't want to feed the financial
industry, I only accept donations as [Bitcoins](https://bitcoin.org/). Please
send your donation to the following Bitcoin address:

If you are unable to send me Bitcoins, please consider making a donation to a
local charity of your choice (e.g. to support homeless people) or to an
international organisation like the Red Cross.

Thank you!

* API key and G+ ID don't get removed anymore in case plugin is unable to connect to the G+ API; it seems that this now happens more often even if all settings are correct; a future version will need a better error reporting mechanism, but unfortunately Wordpress doesn't provide a convenient API for reporting configuration errors to the users and so the plugin will need to come up with an own mechanism
